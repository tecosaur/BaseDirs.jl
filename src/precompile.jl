# Precompilation statements

# We could only load these when `ccall(:jl_generating_output, Cint, ()) == 1`,
# however testing reveals that this makes a negligible difference to the overall
# latency.
#
# The aim here is to reduce the latency experienced by packages using `BaseDirs`.
# This means we want to balance "precompile everything" with compiled code size.
# As such, we'll focus on the most likely entry-points during package setup.
# This is mostly guesswork, but it seems sensible to think that during their setup
# packages would most likely check the User/System directories, possibly based
# on a particular `Project`.
#
# We'll proceed with that in mind, and re-adjust if it seems sensible to do so.
